            Bia National Park is a national park in the Bia district in the Western Region of Ghana. It also a biosphere
            with a 563 square kilometer resource reserve. it has some Ghana's last remnants of relatively untouched forest
            complete with its full diversity of wildlife. Some of the tallest trees left in West Africa are found in this national park. It constitutes a twin conservation area called the Bia National Park and the Bia resource Reserve.
            <br>
            The Bia was created in 1935 ane named after Bia River which drains the area. It became an official national park in 
            1974. Intensive farming destroyed much of the original vegetation in the park. However, since 1975, no human activities
            like farming or logging have taken place. In 1985, the park was named a biosphere reserve and a UNESCO world
            heritage site.

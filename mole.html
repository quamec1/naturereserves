 <h3>Mole National Park</h3>
        <p>Mole National Park is one of Ghana's seven national parks and the country's largest wildlife refuge. The park is located 
            in the Savannah Region of Ghana on savanna and riparian ecosystems at an elevation of 50m, with a sharp escarpment forming 
            the southern boundary of the park. The Park is 24km from Damongo, the district capital, 146km south east of Tamale, the Regional
            capital. The park is 700km from Accra and 430km from Kumasi. <br>
            The park's entrance is reached through the nearby town of Larabanga. It covers an area of about 4,500 square kilometers of fairly
            undisturbed Guinea savannah in the northern part of Ghana. The Levi and Mole Rivers are ephemeral rivers flowing through the park,
            leaving behind only drinking holes during the long dry season. This area of Ghana recieves over 10mm per year of rainfall. 
            A long-term study has been done on Mole National Park to understand the impact of human hunters on the animals in the preserve. <br>
            The park is also Ghana's most developed tourism site in terms of tourist amenities. The reserve has West Africa's first luxury safari
            lodge nestled in the heart of the Mole forest. Zaina the country's premier ecolodge provides world class hospitality service with 
            a unique touch. 
            The park's lands were set aside as a wildlife refuge in 1958. In 1971, the small human population of the area was relocated and the lands
            were designated to a national park. The park has not seen major development as a tourist location since its original designation. The
            Mole National park as a protective area is underfunded and national and international concerns exist about poaching and sustainability
            in the park, but its protection of important resident antelope species has improved since its initial founding as a preserve.  <br>
            Since the resettlement of humans from the area, the park has become an important study area for scientists. This has allowed for some long-term
            studies, in particular, of relatively undisturbed sites compared to similar areas of densely populated equatorial West Africa.

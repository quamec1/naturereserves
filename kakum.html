<h3>Kakum National Park</h3>
        <p>Kakum National Park, located in the coastal environs of the Central Region of Ghana. It covers an area of 375 square kilometers. It was established
            in 1931 as reserve, it was gazetted as national park only in 1992 after an initial survey of avifauna was conducted. The area is covered with tropical
            forest. The uniqueness of this park lies in the fact that it was established at the initiative of the local people and not by the State Department of 
            wildlife who are responsible for wildlife preservation in Ghana. It is one of only 3 locations in Africa with a canopy walkway, which is 350 metres(1,150 ft)
            long and connects seven tree tops which provides access to the forest. <br>
            The most notable endangered species of fauna in the park are Diana monkey, giant bongo antelope, yellow-backed duiker and African elephant.
            It is also an Important Bird Area recognized by the Bird Life International with the bird area fully overlapping the park area. The bird inventory confirmed 266 species in the park, including eight species
            of global conservation concern. One of these species of concern is the white-breasted guineafowl. Nine species of hornbill and the grey parrot have been recorded.
            It also has more than 600 bbutterflies as well, and a new species was discovered in 1993. As of 2012, the densest population of forest elephants in Ghana is 
            located in Kakum.  <br>
            Kakum is Ghana's first protected area which has recieved major support for visitors. The visitor centre opened on the day 1997 and the park recieved the Global
            Tourism for Tomorrow Award the following year. Tourism numbers have increased over the years: 2,000 in 1992; 27,000 in 1996; over 70,000 tourists in 1999; and it attracted

<h3>Atewa-Atwirebu Butterfly Sanctuary</h3>
<p>Atewa-Atwirebu Butterfly Sanctuary (also called Atewa Range Forest Reserve) is in the Akyem Abuakwa region of southeastern
    Ghana, near the town of Kibi and south-west of the Kwahu Plateau which forms the south-west boundary of Lake Volta. The Range
     runs roughly north-south, consisting of steep-sided hills with fairly flat summits. It is the last remains of the Cenozoic peneplain
     that once covered southern Ghana, and contains ancient bauxitic soils. The range is the site of an important forest reserve, and the 
     source of three major rivers. <br>
     A large area of the range has been declared a forest reserve, including about 17,400 hectares of upland evergreen forest, rare for Ghana.
     The reserve is managed by the Forestry Commission of Ghana in collaboration with other stakeholders, key among them is the Okyeman Environment 
     Foundation, which has restricted people from farming in the area and instead is trying to encourage eco-tourism. However, the reserve is under
     pressure from logging and hunting for bushmeat. It is also vulnerable to minig exploration activities, sine the reserve contains gold deposits as 
     well as low-grade bauxite. <br>
     Many of the plant species occur only in this part of Ghana, or in few other localities and part was declared as a specially protected GSBA (Globally 
     Significant Biodiveristy Area) following a national botanic survey of the forest reserves by Ghana Forestry Dept. in the 1990s. The forest reserve contains
     many birds that are rare elsewhere in Ghana including Olive Long-tailed Cuckoo, Rufous-sided Broadbill, Least Honeyguide, Common Bristlebill and 
     Blue-headed Crested-Flycatcher. The reserve has been designated an Important Bird Area(IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant
     populations of many bird species.

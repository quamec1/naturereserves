<h3>Tafi Monkey Village</h3>
    <p>Tafi Monkey Village is a traditional sacred grove conservation established in 1993 under the direction of a Peace
        Corps volunteer as a community-based ecotourism project. Tafi Atome is the home of mona and patas monkeys.
        The sanctuary is located about 230 kilometers Northeast of the capital Accra and 43 kilometers south of Hohoe in the
        Volta regionof Ghana.
        For the past two centuries, the monkeys are found living in the tropical forest around the small village of Tafi-Atome 
        and have been sacred because it was believed they were messengers from the gods. In 1996, the village began broader efforts 
        to protect their forest and monkeys, as well as to offer tours for visitors. The sanctuary was created by a coalition of villagers, 
        public institutions and NGO. As a result of these efforts, the monkey population has increased, and the forest with its many species 
        of birds and butterflies has been preserved.

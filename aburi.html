        <h3>Aburi Botanical Gardens</h3>
            The Aburi Botanical Gardens was established in March 1890 by Governor William Brandford-Griffith and Dr. John Farrel Easmon,
            a Sierra Leonean medical doctor, with a 64.8 hectares (160-acre) botanical reserve and tourist
            attraction located in the Akwapim-Togo Range of Ghana, primarily used for conservation and featuring attractions like
            a palm walk and rock garden. <br>
            One can find in the garden tree species such as silk cotton (ceiba penandra), mahogany, cedar, silver oak and many more.
            In view of its geographical position on the mountain with various tropical tree species and botanical gardens, the town, especially
            the gardens known as te Aburi Botanical Gardens, has become a haven for both foreign and local tourists.
